This is a ReactJS app that I'm developing *solely* for practice, which means it is a headache to go through, and is not meant to be gone through by anyone but me anyways. The only reason I'm putting it up here is because it *may* be my opt-in for Hacktoberfest.

Feel free to go through the code, but I'm telling you, it's very, *very* bad. Also feel free to fork it. ATM issues and PRs are not accepted, although you can open an issue if you wanna discuss something.
